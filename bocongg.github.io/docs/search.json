My hobbies include photography, videography, and watching films (just finished watching the last season of The Blacklist!). If you are interested, I have a photography IG account (@mbe.z) but I haven’t been updating it recently because of school… I will be participating in the Student Exchange Program at the University of Sydney in the next semester, and I am excited to get back into photography and perhaps videography!\n\n\n Back to top"
