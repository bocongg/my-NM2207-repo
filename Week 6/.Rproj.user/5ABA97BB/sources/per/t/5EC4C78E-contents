## Questions
<br>

#### Question-1: Countdown Blastoff (While Loop)

Create a program that simulates a rocket launch countdown using a while loop. Start from 10 and countdown to "Blastoff!" with a one-second delay between each countdown number. Print a message when the rocket launches.

**Hint:** You may want to use `cat` command to print the countdown and `Sys.sleep` for incorporating the delay

**Output preview:** Here is how the countdown could look like 

```{r, out.height= "20px",out.width= "200px",eval=F,echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/countdown.png")
```

```{r, out.height= "20px",out.width= "200px",eval=F,echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/blastoff.png")
```

**Solutions:**

```{r, eval=T,echo=TRUE}
count <- 10

while (count > 0){
  cat(count, "...")
  count <- count - 1
  Sys.sleep(1)
}
cat("Blastoff!")

```

#### Question-2: Word Reverser (for Loop)

Develop a program that takes a user-entered word and uses a while loop to print the word's characters in reverse order. For example, if the user enters "hello," the program should print "olleh."

**Hint:** You may want to use `substr` command to access each character of the input word, and `paste` command to join the reversed letters one at a time

**Solutions:** 

```{r, eval=T,echo=TRUE}
word_reverser <- function(word){
  output <- c()
  
  for (i in nchar(word):1){
   output <- c(output, substr(word, i, i))

  }
  
  paste(output, collapse = "")
}

word <- readline("Your word:")
word <- "hello"
word_reverser(word)

```
